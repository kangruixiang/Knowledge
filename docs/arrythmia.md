## Atrial Flutter

#### Related Question

- Question 12

Atrial flutter is an organized macro-reentrant tachycardia with discrete regular atrial activity on ECG, usually with a rate of 250/min to 300/min. Typical atrial flutter is characterized electrocardiographically by a sawtooth pattern with inverted flutter waves in leads II, III, and aVF and positive flutter waves in lead V1 (**[Figure 14](https://mksap18.acponline.org/app/topics/cv/figures/mk18_a_cv_f14)**). Typical atrial flutter is the result of counterclockwise reentry around the tricuspid annulus. In atypical flutter, the circuit can travel in a clockwise direction or can occur in other locations in the right and left atria. Atypical flutter may occur after ablation or after congenital or valvular cardiac surgery.

Management of atrial flutter is similar to atrial fibrillation management; however, a rhythm control strategy is favored in atrial flutter because rate control may be difficult and often requires high doses of more than one AV nodal blocker. Catheter ablation is the definitive treatment for typical atrial flutter, owing to a very high success rate (>95%) and low complication rate. Oral anticoagulation in patients with atrial flutter is approached in the same manner as in patients with atrial fibrillation.

## Key Point

- Catheter ablation is the definitive treatment of typical atrial flutter, owing to a very high success rate (>95%) and low complication rate.

## Supraventricular Tachycardias

### Clinical Presentation

#### Related Question

- Question 98

SVTs are rapid heart rhythms that arise from the atrium or require conduction through the AV node. Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter are technically SVTs, although the term generally pertains to paroxysmal SVTs. SVTs can affect all age groups but frequently occur in younger patients. Prevalence is higher in women than in men. SVTs usually occur in the absence of structural heart disease, although echocardiography should be performed to exclude underlying cardiac dysfunction or structural defects. Patients often have repeated episodes of tachycardia and may report palpitations, a sensation of pounding in the neck, fatigue, lightheadedness, chest discomfort, dyspnea, presyncope, and, less commonly, syncope.

The ECG typically demonstrates a narrow-complex tachycardia; however, wide QRS complexes (>120 ms) may be present in cases of bundle branch block, aberrancy, pacing, or anterograde accessory pathway conduction (antidromic tachycardia). SVTs may be classified electrocardiographically according to the relationship of the P wave and the QRS complex. Short-RP tachycardias (RP interval < PR interval) feature a P wave that closely follows the QRS complex, whereas long-RP tachycardias feature a P wave that is more than half the distance between the RR interval (RP interval > PR interval). Short-RP tachycardias include typical AVNRT, AVRT, and junctional tachycardia. Long-RP tachycardias include atypical AVNRT, sinus tachycardia, and atrial tachycardia.

Vagal maneuvers, including the Valsalva maneuver (bearing down), carotid sinus massage, or facial immersion in cold water, are first-line therapy to restore sinus rhythm in patients with SVT. Adenosine can be used to terminate SVT and simultaneously help diagnose its cause. Tachycardias that terminate with adenosine are typically AV node dependent (AVNRT and AVRT), whereas continued atrial activity (P waves) during AV block is consistent with atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia.

### Atrioventricular Nodal Reentrant Tachycardia

AVNRT accounts for two thirds of all cases of SVT, not including cases of atrial fibrillation and flutter. AVNRT is the result of a reentrant circuit within the AV node that uses both the fast and slow pathways. Typical AVNRT involves conduction down the slow pathway and back up to the atrium over the fast pathway (slow-fast). This conduction pattern results in a short RP interval with a retrograde P wave inscribed very close to the QRS complex (**[Figure 15](https://mksap18.acponline.org/app/topics/cv/figures/mk18_a_cv_f15)**). Atypical AVNRT occurs when the impulse travels down the fast pathway and returns to the atrium via the slow pathway (fast-slow), resulting in a long RP interval.

AVNRT may be terminated with vagal maneuvers or adenosine. AV nodal blocking therapy with β-blockers or calcium channel blockers is used to prevent recurrent AVNRT. In patients with recurrent AVNRT and patients who do not tolerate or prefer to avoid long-term medical therapy, catheter ablation should be considered. Catheter ablation of AVNRT has a high success rate, although it is associated with a 1% risk for injury to the AV node necessitating pacemaker implantation.

### Atrioventricular Reciprocating Tachycardia

#### Related Question

- Question 19

AVRT is an accessory pathway (bypass tract)–mediated tachycardia that is often observed as preexcitation on ECG (**[Figure 16](https://mksap18.acponline.org/app/topics/cv/figures/mk18_a_cv_f16)**). Early ventricular activation over the accessory pathway causes shortening of the PR interval, and the initial part of the QRS complex is slurred because of premature ventricular depolarization in the myocardial tissue adjacent to the accessory pathway. In AVRT, the tachycardia can conduct anterograde over the AV node (orthodromic AVRT) or anterograde over the accessory pathway (antidromic AVRT). Orthodromic AVRT is the most common type of AVRT, accounting for more than 90% to 95% of cases. This type of AVRT has a narrow QRS complex, owing to conduction over the AV node and the His-Purkinje system. Antidromic AVRT is characterized by a wide, slurred QRS complex resulting from conduction over the bypass tract and activation of the ventricle without use of the specialized conduction system. Adenosine can be given to terminate orthodromic AVRT; however, adenosine and other AV nodal blockers are contraindicated in cases of antidromic AVRT.

Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is defined by symptomatic AVRT with evidence of preexcitation on resting ECG (delta wave). It is often seen in patients with Ebstein anomaly. Atrial fibrillation occurs in up to one third of patients with WPW syndrome. Rapid conduction over an accessory pathway in atrial fibrillation can result in VF and sudden cardiac death (SCD), although this occurs in less than 1% of cases of WPW syndrome.

In patients with preexcitation on ECG, stress testing can effectively risk-stratify patients; patients in whom preexcitation is lost during exercise are generally at low risk for ventricular arrhythmia and SCD. Electrophysiology testing is also helpful in determining the risk for SCD and in localizing the pathway to facilitate catheter ablation. Catheter ablation is first-line therapy for patients with WPW syndrome and has a high success rate; however, ablation success is dictated by the location of the bypass tract. Antiarrhythmic therapy is considered second-line therapy. In patients with accessory pathways close to the AV node, antiarrhythmic drug therapy is particularly useful because catheter ablation carries an unacceptable risk for iatrogenic heart block.

In asymptomatic patients with preexcitation on ECG, management is controversial. Invasive testing is generally not required, unless the patient has a high-risk occupation, such as a commercial airline pilot.

### Premature Atrial Contractions and Atrial Tachycardia

Premature atrial contractions (PACs) are early isolated beats that arise from the atria. They are exceedingly common, and their frequency increases with age. During ambulatory ECG monitoring, only 1% of persons have no PACs. High PAC burden is associated with increased risk for atrial fibrillation. Symptomatic PACs are typically treated with β-blockers or calcium channel blockers.

Atrial tachycardia can arise in the presence or absence of structural heart disease. Drugs can cause atrial tachycardia; digoxin toxicity can cause paroxysmal atrial tachycardia with atrioventricular block. Stopping the causative drug, or initiating β-blocker or calcium channel blocker therapy, is first-line treatment for symptomatic atrial tachycardia. Second-line treatment consists of catheter ablation or antiarrhythmic drug therapy. Ablation success rates are generally lower in patients with atrial tachycardia than in patients with other SVTs.

Multifocal atrial tachycardia is typified by three or more P-wave morphologies and a heart rate greater than 100/min (**[Figure 17](https://mksap18.acponline.org/app/topics/cv/figures/mk18_a_cv_f17)**). It is usually seen in patients with end-stage COPD.

## Key Points

- Vagal maneuvers, including the Valsalva maneuver, carotid sinus massage, or facial immersion in cold water, may restore sinus rhythm in patients with supraventricular tachycardia.
- Patients with recurrent atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia are treated with atrioventricular nodal blocking agents (β-blockers or calcium channel blockers) or catheter ablation.
- First-line therapy for patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is catheter ablation; antiarrhythmic therapy is reserved for second-line therapy.

## Wide-Complex Tachycardia

A wide-complex tachycardia is any tachycardia with a QRS complex of 120 ms or greater. Differential diagnoses include SVT with aberrancy, preexcited tachycardia (antidromic tachycardia), ventricular paced rhythm, and VT.

In adult patients with structural heart disease, 95% of wide-complex tachycardias are VT. Several important clinical and ECG features can distinguish VT from other conditions. Wide-complex tachycardias that are positive in lead aVR, have a QRS morphology that is concordant (all predominantly positive or negative) in the precordial leads, have QRS morphology other than typical right or left bundle branch block, and exhibit extreme axis deviation (“northwest” axis) are usually VT. AV dissociation, fusion beats, and capture beats are all highly suggestive of VT (**[Figure 18](https://mksap18.acponline.org/app/topics/cv/figures/mk18_a_cv_f18)**). When the origin of a wide-complex tachycardia cannot be determined, VT should be assumed until expert consultation can be obtained.

## Ventricular Arrhythmias

### Premature Ventricular Contractions

#### Related Question

- Question 72

Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) occur in up to 75% of healthy persons. Symptoms include palpitations or the perception of skipped beats. Forceful beats are caused by increased cardiac filling during the pause following the PVC. PVCs are more common in patients with hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, previous myocardial infarction, and other forms of structural heart disease, such as nonischemic cardiomyopathy.

In the absence of high-risk features (syncope, a family history of premature SCD, structural heart disease), reassurance is appropriate management. PVCs require treatment when symptoms are bothersome or frequent (>10% of all beats or 10,000 PVCs per day). Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy may result from frequent PVCs (see [Heart Failure](https://mksap18.acponline.org/app/topics/cv/mk18_a_cv_s4/mk18_a_cv_s4_10_4)).

First-line treatment for PVC suppression is β-blocker or calcium channel blocker therapy. β-Blockers are preferred in patients with ventricular dysfunction. If PVCs persist despite β-blockade or calcium channel blockade, antiarrhythmic drug therapy may be used. The selection of an antiarrhythmic medication for PVC suppression depends on many factors, including kidney function and comorbid conditions. In young healthy patients without structural heart disease, class IC drugs are usually effective. Amiodarone is most commonly used in patients with structural heat disease, particularly heart failure. Catheter ablation should be considered in patients with continued frequent PVCs despite medical therapy, those who cannot tolerate medical therapy, and patients who develop PVC-related left ventricular dysfunction.

### Ventricular Tachycardia with Structural Heart Disease

In ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathy, the presence of myocardial scar tissue facilitates a reentry circuit and the development of VT. VT is usually regular and monomorphic in patients with ventricular scarring. Sustained VT (≥30 seconds) can lead to hypotension, syncope, VF, and cardiac arrest; however, short episodes of VT (nonsustained) or slow sustained VT may be well tolerated or cause no symptoms.

Evaluation with resting ECG, exercise treadmill testing (to provoke arrhythmias), and cardiac imaging (to identify structural heart disease) is indicated in all patients with VT. Patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy who present with VT should be considered for angiography and revascularization if appropriate. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging clarifies the extent and pattern of myocardial scarring, which can be helpful in refining the cause of the cardiomyopathy and can assist in determining prognosis. For example, patients with a higher burden of myocardial scarring have higher risk for recurrent arrhythmia.

β-Blockers and ACE inhibitors reduce the risk for SCD in patients with prior myocardial infarction and cardiomyopathy. In those with recurrent VT despite β-blocker therapy, antiarrhythmic drug therapy with amiodarone may be considered. Catheter ablation should be considered in patients with recurrent VT despite medical therapy. ICD placement is indicated for secondary prevention of SCD in patients with structural heart disease or cardiomyopathy who have sustained VT/VF, provided that reversible causes have been excluded (such as acute coronary ischemia or cocaine ingestion).

### Idiopathic Ventricular Tachycardia

Idiopathic VT (so-called normal heart VT) occurs in the absence of structural heart disease, typically arising from the outflow tracts, fascicles, and papillary muscles. Patients with idiopathic VT usually present with palpitations in the third to fifth decades of life. Episodes of syncope are uncommon. Arrhythmic events are often triggered by stress, emotion, or exercise. These tachycardias are responsive to adenosine.

Calcium channel blockers, especially verapamil, and β-blockers are first-line treatment for idiopathic VT. Catheter ablation can be considered if symptoms continue despite these therapies. ICDs are contraindicated in patients with hemodynamically stable idiopathic VT, owing to the benign prognosis and efficacy of other therapies.

## Key Point

- The primary treatment for patients with premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) without high-risk features (syncope, a family history of premature sudden cardiac death, structural heart disease) is reassurance; treatment is reserved for those with bothersome symptoms or frequent PVCs.

## Inherited Arrhythmia Syndromes

#### Related Question

- Question 81

Patients younger than age 40 years with unexplained SCD, unexplained near drowning, or recurrent exertional syncope, who do not have ischemic or other structural heart disease, should be evaluated for inherited arrhythmia syndromes. Additionally, unexplained premature death (age <35 years) or sudden death in a first-degree family member (age <40 years) should raise suspicion for an inherited arrhythmia syndrome and prompt referral to a cardiovascular specialist, with genetic counseling and genetic testing as indicated by clinical findings. The diagnosis of inherited arrhythmia syndromes can be complicated because of variable penetrance and expressivity of these disorders. Characteristic findings and treatments for these syndromes are reviewed in **[Table 20](https://mksap18.acponline.org/app/topics/cv/tables/mk18_a_cv_t20)**.

Long QT syndrome is among the most common inherited arrhythmias, affecting between 1 in 1000 and 1 in 5000 persons. Prolongation of the QTc interval has many causes, most of which are acquired, such as medication use, structural heart disease, and electrolyte abnormalities. Drugs that have been implicated in QT prolongation include antiarrhythmic agents, antibiotics (including some macrolides and fluoroquinolones), antipsychotic drugs, and antidepressants. A list of drugs categorized by their potential to cause QT prolongation is available at <https://crediblemeds.org>. The presence of a prolonged QTc interval (>440 ms in men and >460 ms in women) alone is insufficient to diagnose long QT syndrome. Diagnosis requires the presence of a QTc interval greater than 500 ms on repeated 12-lead ECGs accompanied by unexplained syncope or ventricular arrhythmia. Patients with a QTc interval greater than 500 ms are at greatest risk for SCD. β-Blockers are first-line therapy; however, patients with cardiac arrest or those who have recurrent events (syncope or VT) refractory to β-blocker therapy are candidates for ICD placement. These patients should not participate in competitive athletics.

Short QT syndrome is a rare and genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by a short QT interval (QT <340 ms or QTc <350 ms). It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Patients can present with atrial and ventricular arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation, polymorphic VT, and VF) and syncope. Patients with short QT syndrome are considered to be at very high risk for SCD; therefore, ICD placement is recommended in all patients.

Brugada syndrome is distinguished by right precordial ECG abnormalities, including ST-segment coving (concave or linear downsloping ST segment) in leads V1 to V3 with or without right bundle branch block, VF, and cardiac arrest (**[Figure 19](https://mksap18.acponline.org/app/topics/cv/figures/mk18_a_cv_f19)**). Brugada syndrome has an increased prevalence in men and persons of Asian descent. Arrhythmic events in patients with Brugada syndrome are more common at night during sleep. Abnormalities on ECG can be intermittent and may be elicited by fever or pharmacologic challenge with sodium channel blockade (such as with procainamide infusion). Patients with syncope or ventricular arrhythmia should undergo ICD implantation. Quinidine may be beneficial in patients with recurrent ventricular arrhythmias and/or ICD shocks.

Catecholaminergic polymorphic VT is a rare disorder characterized by intracellular calcium overload, polymorphic ventricular arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest. The arrhythmias are usually triggered by high-adrenergic states, including strong emotion and exercise. These arrhythmias can also be provoked with epinephrine infusion. β-Blocker therapy and ICD placement are treatments. Patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic VT should avoid exercise.

Early repolarization syndrome should be strongly suspected in patients with unexplained VF arrest, particularly when provoked during exercise. Early repolarization (J-point elevation) is a common and usually benign ECG finding; however, the presence of inferior and lateral early repolarization of more than 1 mm in a patient with VF and/or cardiac arrest should be considered early repolarization syndrome. ICD implantation is indicated in patients with VF or cardiac arrest.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia (ARVC/D) can often present as SCD in young persons. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and arrhythmic risk stratification are discussed in [Myocardial Disease](https://mksap18.acponline.org/app/topics/cv/mk18_a_cv_s7/mk18_a_cv_s7_1_3). Most patients with ARVC/D present between puberty and young adulthood; however, it can also occur in older age. Patients with ARVC/D usually present with frequent ventricular ectopy and/or monomorphic VT, although severe cases can present with heart failure. The diagnosis is established by ECG abnormalities, family history, the presence of arrhythmias, and structural abnormalities of the right ventricle. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging can demonstrate enlargement (segments of poorly contracting heart muscle), focal aneurysms, and wall motion abnormalities in the right ventricle (hypokinesis). ARVC/D is usually progressive, and patients with ARVC/D should abstain from vigorous exercise. Patients with ARVC/D and cardiac arrest or risk factors (nonsustained VT, inducible VT) should be offered ICD implantation. β-Blockers are first-line therapy for ventricular arrhythmia, although antiarrhythmic therapy with sotalol or amiodarone or catheter ablation is often required for recurrent VT.

## Key Point

- Unexplained premature death (at age <35 years) or sudden death in a first-degree family member should raise suspicion for an inherited arrhythmia syndrome and prompt referral to a cardiovascular specialist.

## Sudden Cardiac Arrest

### Epidemiology and Risk Factors

SCD is defined as an instantaneous fatal event or collapse within 1 hour of symptom onset in an apparently healthy person. In patients in whom death was unwitnessed, SCD is considered to have occurred if the patient was known to be alive and well within the past 24 hours. VT and VF are the most common causes of SCD.

In the United States, more than 350,000 episodes of SCD occur each year. The annual risk for SCD is 1:1000 in the general population. The highest incidence occurs in patients with pre-existing structural heart disease, although left ventricular function is normal in most patients experiencing SCD. Risk factors include heart failure, diminished left ventricular function, previous myocardial infarction, unexplained syncope, left ventricular hypertrophy, nonsustained ventricular arrhythmia, chronic kidney disease, and sleep apnea. It is important to distinguish between myocardial infarction and SCD when a family history of cardiac disease is obtained.

### Acute Management

Cardiac arrest necessitates immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and advanced cardiac life support. Basic life support guidelines emphasize the importance of immediate, rapid, and sustained chest compressions in caring for individuals with cardiac arrest. Following activation of the emergency medical system and request for an automated external defibrillator, the patient's pulse should be checked immediately. Chest compressions should be initiated if no definite pulse is detected within 10 seconds. High-quality CPR (30 compressions and 2 breaths per cycle if no advanced airway is present) includes adequate depression of the lower sternum at a rate of at least 100 compressions per minute with adequate time for chest recoil. Interruptions in chest compressions should be minimized. Once an airway has been secured, breaths should be delivered at a rate of 1 breath per 6 seconds (10/min) to avoid breath stacking and increased thoracic pressure, which impedes cardiac output. Defibrillation should occur as soon as possible in patients with a shockable rhythm because time to defibrillation is an important determinant of the likelihood of survival to hospital discharge.

According to the 2020 American Heart Association advanced life support guidelines, the presence or absence of a shockable rhythm guides management after CPR has been initiated. In patients with asystole or pulseless electrical activity, CPR is continued with reassessment of rhythm status for a shockable rhythm every 2 minutes. Epinephrine should be administered intravenously to increase coronary perfusion. Vasopressin provides no advantages over epinephrine. Likewise, atropine should not be used for the treatment of asystole or pulseless electrical activity arrest. Any reversible causes (such as tamponade) should be identified and treated.

Patients with VT/VF should be shocked, followed by immediate resumption of CPR and reassessment of the rhythm in 2 minutes. Epinephrine should be administered after the second shock and every 3 to 5 minutes thereafter. Amiodarone should be given as a bolus if VT/VF continues despite three shocks and epinephrine administration. A second dose of amiodarone can be given if VT/VF persists.

Patients with suspected opioid overdose should receive naloxone, but emergency response systems should be requested immediately and should not be dependent on an observed response to the naloxone.

### Device Therapy for Prevention of Sudden Death

ICDs have demonstrated efficacy in the primary and secondary prevention of SCD. Patients with sustained ventricular arrhythmias (>30 seconds) or cardiac arrest without a reversible cause have a class I recommendation for secondary prevention ICD placement. Patients with heart failure who meet specific criteria should undergo ICD placement for primary prevention (see [Heart Failure](https://mksap18.acponline.org/app/topics/cv/mk18_a_cv_s4/mk18_a_cv_s4_6_1)). Patients with heart failure and interventricular conduction defects (predominantly left bundle branch block) often benefit from cardiac resynchronization therapy or cardiac resynchronization therapy in combination with a defibrillator.

Patients with ICDs need to avoid strenuous upper extremity exercises, including weight lifting, because of concern for lead stress and subsequent fracture. Inappropriate detection of VT/VF and shocks can result from electromagnetic interference; therefore, patients need to avoid devices that pose risks, such as arc welding equipment and high-voltage machinery. Patients with ICDs who are undergoing invasive procedures or surgery should be evaluated by their electrophysiologist for device reprogramming recommendations.

In the past, ICDs were implanted almost exclusively by using a transvenous approach. New techniques allow for implantation of defibrillators in the lateral chest at the midaxillary line adjacent to the heart with tunneling of the lead under the skin next to the sternum. Subcutaneous defibrillators have several advantages, including reduced risk for device infection.

## Key Point

- Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators are effective for primary and secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death.

## Device Infection

#### Related Question

- Question 105

Device infections have many different forms, ranging from pocket infections to endocarditis. Most infections are due to _Staphylococcus epidermidis_ and _Staphylococcus aureus_. Symptoms of cardiac device infection include fever, chills, malaise, lassitude, and failure to thrive, particularly in the elderly.

Physical examination of the pocket may reveal erythema, swelling, drainage, or wound dehiscence. In patients suspected of having device infection, several blood cultures, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and a C-reactive protein level should be obtained. A transesophageal echocardiogram should be obtained to evaluate for intracardiac or lead vegetations. Aspirating the device pocket is never indicated because this can damage the leads or introduce infection in a sterile or uninfected pocket. PET-CT can also identify infection of the device pocket or leads if other testing is inconclusive.

Treatment of cardiac device infection includes complete extraction of all hardware, debridement of the pocket, sustained antibiotic therapy, and reimplantation at a new location after infection has been eradicated.
